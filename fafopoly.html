              "Faf" is the acronym for the
              <b>Faculty of Architecture of Ferrara</b>. To celebrate the
              graduation of some classmates, this game was devised, focused on
              the spaces shared together and especially on the people in the
              class.

              Instead of the four iconic stations on the Monopoly board, they
              have been replaced with the four most important
              <b>events in Ferrara</b>:<br />
              "Il Palio", "Buskers Festival”, “Interno Verde” and the
              "Internazionale Festival." <br /><br />The player who manages to
              acquire all four symbolizes the creative director in the game.
              <br /><br />Instead of the utilities (electricity and water in the
              original game), two "parties" have been inserted, the recurring
              ones that the class attended. <br /><br />Furthermore, instead of
              "Jail," there is "Quarantine," because the game is also set in the
              temporal context of 2021. <br /><br />In the parking lot, bicycles
              are depicted because Ferrara is known as the city of bicycles.

              Even the money is customized for the city of Ferrara: various
              monuments have been featured and classified by "importance" on the
              banknotes. <br /><br />For example, the smallest denomination of
              currency features a palace where an architectural survey exam was
              held together.
