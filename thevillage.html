              A 4K-inhabitants town, built in XIII century on the Gargano
              promontory, is currently facing a critical situation. <br /><br />
              Too many cars along a few roads and no alternatives to drive
              around. <br />The realization of a new suburban road, quite far
              from the downtown, would return public space and pathways to
              pedestrians.<br /><br />
              <b>Why can't heaven be a place on Earth?</b> <br />Ischitella is
              nestled on a quiet and woody hill but it returns a destorted
              self-image of noise, traffic and air pollution.<br />
              Walking around is messy and complicated, and this made inhabitants
              get used to take the wheel even when unnecessary.

              The town has a unique focal point composed of a main square (in
              orange) and an uphill boulevard (in yellow). <br /><br />The
              boulevard hosts most of the shops and the trading activities, thus
              often resulting in traffic jams. <br /><br />The overuse of
              vehicles also threatens the integrity of the historical character
              of the town. <br /><br />
              <b>A roller coaster</b><br />
              Despite the double choice a car driver has to move from A to B,
              there is currently only one way back to A from B. Intervention is
              necessary to balance the vehicles circulation.

              <br /><br />
              Roundabouts on the A-B-C points enable a continuous and
              non-invasive driving throughout the town. <br /><br />In this way,
              the square and the uphill boulevard become a single place (in
              yellow) reserved exclusively for man. <br /><br />
              <b>Where to hide cars?</b><br />
              In new parking areas placed at the entrances of the town (in red).
              People will leave their own cars and reach the downtown by
              walking. <br /><br />A car-free boulevard will both improve the
              shopping time and help counteracting pollution.

              The external appearance of the town may undergo changes,
              potentially leading to concerns about its compatibility with the
              surrounding natural environment.<br /><br />
              The primary objective pursued is to <b>restore the town</b> to its
              original seventeenth-century form and function: the square and the
              uphill boulevard will merge into one large square primarily
              designed for <b>pedestrians</b>. <br /><br />
              As for automobiles, their circulation will be redirected to the
              outskirts, allowing for the reactivation of some historic streets
              connecting new parking areas to the main square, thereby
              revitalizing them.<br /><br />
              Green elements will be integrated into the area between the new
              road and the town, serving to <b>enhance nature's presence</b> and
              mitigate noise from the road.<br /><br />
              It's important to note that this project is set in 2071, and the
              thesis work also encompasses research on <b>automobile usage</b>,
              particularly focusing on electric cars, autonomous vehicles, and
              car-sharing. These innovations are expected to reduce noise and
              alleviate parking demands.
